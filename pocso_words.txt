More convictions mean - that either the person convicted has been 
booked for multiple acts and sections, or there are multiple cases with
convictions

If there are acquitted and conviced in the same judgement, then there 
can be multiple people involved in the incident out of which some are
convicted and some are acquitted

Usually there are cases with a single order of acquitted or convicted
